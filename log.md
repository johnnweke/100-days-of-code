# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finally started the 100 days of code. Learning about HTML again. Learned about tags and input forms. 

**Thoughts:** I keep starting and stopping with this web design thing but I have no excuses now! I've committed to it publicly, but most of all, I need accountabilibuddies to help me stay on track. I want to be a really good junior dev with JS by June 2019.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 15, 2018 
**Time invested:** 1 hr

**Today's Progress**: Finally started the 100 days of code. Learning about HTML again. Learned about tags and input forms. 

**Milestone:** Completed Intro to HTML & HTML5 on [FreecodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)

**Thoughts:** I kept starting and stopping with this web design thing since 2013 but I have no excuses now. I've committed to it publicly, but most of all, I need accountabilibuddies to help me stay on track. 

**Goal:** I want to be a really good junior dev with JS by June 2019.

### Day 2: Friday, Nov 16, 2018 
**Time invested:** 1 hr

**Today's Progress**: I started on CSS Findamentals with Freecode camp today. 

**Milestone:** Completed 18 checkpoints within 1 hr. 

**Thoughts:** I think doing the code sprints in the morning will be better. I am technically doing them Saturday morning of the 17th at 2am because I didn't get to it earlier on the 16th. I'm also learning to take notes with Evernote. Putting my phone on airplane mode helps avoid distractions.

### Day 3: Mon, Nov 19, 2018 
**Time invested:** 2 hrs+

**Today's Progress**:  Learned about CSS Variables - basically functions in CSS! Who knew CSS could act as a pseudo-programming language? Started learning about media queries. CSS has A LOT of stuff. Looking forward to using it all though. 

**Milestone:** Completed the **Basic Intro to CSS** section; Started the **Applied Design** section 

**Thoughts:** I missed 2 days of the program, I was trying to make up. I am learning the power of compounded continuity though. Freecodecamp's bite sized chunks is really making this easier to digest. Thank You @freecodecamp!
